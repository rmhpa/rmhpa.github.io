<h2>Tutorial</h2>
<h3>Water Vapor imagery</h3>
<p>Geostationary weather satellites are able to show water vapor density in
  the upper third of our atmosphere. As a result the upper airflow becomes
  visible, and ridges and troughs are easy to identify. Watch for moisture
  inflow. Can you identify the Tropical Jet Stream? </p>
<p>Sharp contrasts between black and white often indicate strong temperature
  gradients. We could call them &#8220;Upper air fronts&#8221;. These fronts
  are sure to bring unsettled weather to the surface, so as soaring pilots
  we do not want to see them close to our flying area.</p>
<p>Because big thunderstorm cells and mountain waves tend to condensate water
  at very high altitudes, they show up very well on water vapor images. In
  this picture for example we can clearly identify a Mesoscale Convective
  System (MCS) over Oklahoma, a cluster of thunderstorms that grew together
  overnight and usually dissipate by dawn.</p>
<h3>Infrared Imagery</h3>
<p>If our &#8220;Eyes in Space&#8221; look at the earth in a spectrum just
  below of what the human eye can see, we are looking at the infrared spectrum
  (IR). In IR mode we are comparing temperatures. The cooler something is,
  the whiter it appears in the image.</p>
<p>Often times in the early morning, when we want to know whether we will
  be able to go to the mountains and have some fun flying, the sun has not
  been up yet long enough to allow us to look at a satellite loop in the visible
  spectrum. So we have to look at an IR image, which is independent from sunlight.
  What we have to keep in mind is that we are not looking at actual clouds,
  but simply comparing temperatures. This means that low clouds (warm) might
  not show up at all, while high (cold) cirrus clouds appear in bright white.
</p>
<p>Due to their altitude and the associated cold temperatures, thunderstorm
  tops and mountain waves show up very well in IR. Watch for long, north-south
  oriented bright white clouds that do not appear to move in a loop. These
  will most likely be lenticular clouds indicating very high winds aloft and
  extreme turbulence in the mountains. Better fly another day&#8230;</p>
<h3> Upper Air analysis</h3>
<p>Meteorologists, for whatever reason, do not like to look at the earth&#8217;s
  atmosphere in terms of constant altitude levels, but rather constant pressure
  levels. One advantage of this method is, that we always know where we are
  at relative to the mass of the atmosphere that weighs down on us. If we
  assume for example that at sea level, the earth&#8217;s atmospheric pressure
  is exactly 1000 milibars (mb), we know that at 500 mb we are exactly half
  way up through the atmosphere. This happens to be at around 18,000 feet
  MSL or about 5,700 meters or about 570 deca meters (dm).</p>
<p>A 500mb constant pressure chart is an excellent basis for looking at what
  is going on in the upper atmosphere. Why should I care about what is happening
  at 18,000 feet if I never discovered the secret of thermaling and always
  seem to have sled rides straight to the LZ? Well, because it is often the
  upper atmosphere that causes the weather closer to the surface. Think of
  the upper atmosphere as the master of the lower atmosphere. In order to
  truly understand the lower levels, we have to first figure out what the
  uppers are up to.</p>
<p>Right away we notice the black wavy lines. These are called contour lines
  and they are lines of equal height. What height? The height (or altitude
  if you will) at which we can find 500mb of pressure. The reason why heights
  vary is the fact that warm temperatures tend to expand, while cold temperatures
  contract our atmosphere. This means that our 500mb pressure level forms
  a landscape with hills and valleys, that meteorologist call ridges and troughs.
  Troughs form a U-shaped pattern and mean colder temperatures aloft, while
  ridges go the other way and mean warmer temperatures aloft.</p>
<p>We also notice that the winds aloft seem to follow the black contour lines.
  Not only that but there is also a direct relationship between the spacing
  of the contour lines and the wind strength. The tighter the contour lines
  are spaced, the stronger the winds aloft will be. This especially happens
  around and ahead of troughs, which often bring storms over the mountains.
  The strongest winds aloft can form a band of 50+ knot winds. This is called
  the jet stream and in the summer time, we usually find it far to our north
  at around 30,000 feet. However, in the wintertime the big scale weather
  patterns shift, and the jet stream can sometimes be right upon us. Beware
  of flying on those days.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The best flying days in the Front Range are usually brought on by a big
  ridge over Colorado, which pushes the high winds to the north and sometimes
  brings in stable and warm air putting a lid on afternoon thunderstorms.<br />
