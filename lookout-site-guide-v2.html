    <p><strong><img src="/images/mgaggle.jpg" alt="Mt. Zion" width="200" height="150" class="img-responsive"/> Mt. Zion (Lookout Mtn):</strong> The Lookout flying site, located on Mt. Zion in Golden, has restricted landing fields, is in the public eye, and is one of very few sites along the Front Range. Lookout Launch is located on Jefferson County Open Space land. Lookout LZ is owned by the Colorado School of Mines and by the City of Golden. We fly with permission of these organizations and are required to restrict flying at Lookout to qualified pilots. With that said, we&rsquo;ll do everything we can to help qualified pilots enjoy this great flying site as much as we do!</p>
	  <p> Th site is at approximately 6500ft MSL, 900ft above the primary LZ. Launches include possible NE, E, and SE. It's primarily a thermal site with little ridge soaring opportunity. Flying is possible year round. It has good XC potential; the Colorado state hang gliding record was set here - 187 miles by Brad Koji, and paragliding record of 102 miles by Jan Voegeli.</p>
		<ul>
		  <li>Primary LZ is at the base of the  mountain, about 400 yds by 200 yds on Colorado School of Mines property. </li>
	      <li>Minimum Pilot Rating for visiting pilots - Hang 3 for Hanglider and P3 for Paraglider pilots<br />
            </li>
	      <li>Times to Fly - Mornings are mostly calm, suitable for sponsoring new pilots. Midday finds strong thermal activity with frequent thunderstorms from May-August. Evenings occasionally glass off. </li>
	  </ul>
		<p> You must be a member of the USHPA and the RMHPA to fly this site due to landowner liability issues and you must meet RMHPA requirements for flying this site. </p>


    <p>All new pilots require a walkthrough, this is an excellent opportunity to join our community.</p>

<div class="">
  North Launch
</div><div class="">

<p>The most commonly used launch.  This launch faces north east, and works in north east, east and north conditions.  Strong south wind is dangerous, mechanical turbulance forms close to the hill as the wind wraps around the spine just south of launch. </p>

<p>North launch has several wind socks to help monitor variable conditions.</p>

<p>Avoid flying deep in Clear Creek canyon to the north.  Avoid thermalling deep behind the hill above launch.</p>

<p>Paragliders typically setup and launch slightly higher up the hill.  Hang gliders setup and often launch from a position lower down.  There are tie downs for hang gliders in the staging area.</p>

<p>Experienced pilots tend to prefer the North launch as it is easier to determine a South wind component.  Avoid flying in strong south conditions. </p>

</div>

<div class="">
  South Launch
</div>
    <div class="">
      <p>The south launch is a gently sloping grassy field at the top of a wide bowl.  This launch works in all conditions except north. Avoid flying in strong south conditions.</p>

      <p>Windy gap lies just to the south, and can have strong venturi. Avoid this area. The Miner's field landing zone is visible just to the south.</p>

      <p>Several Tandem operations use the south launch extensively.  There is plenty of room to give Tandem pilots the space they need to work safely.  Individual pilots have many options to lay out and launch without affecting Tandem pilots.</p>

  <div class="panel-heading">Primary Landing Zone</div>
  <div class="panel-body">


    The primary LZ is about 400 yds by 200 yds and is surrounded by obstacles.  Pilots choosing to land here must note:
    <ul>
      <li>Highway 93</li>
      <li>Trees and irrigation ditch along the south side of the lz.</li>
      <li>The deep ditch separating the larger east and smaller west landing areas.</li>
      <li>The concrete structure at bottom of the detention pond.</li>
    </ul>

<p>
    In spite of the obstacles the ground gently slopes up to the south, down to the north effectively creating a larger LZ.  The area west of the deep ditch is very landable in a S to SW flow at the end of the day.</p>

    <p>In mid-day conditions this LZ can be very thermic and is best used by advanced pilots only.</p>

    <p>The detention pond is almost always dry during flyable conditions.</p>

    <p>Pilots typically start setting up an approach after getting below the first switchback of the Lookout Mountaing road.</p>

    <p>There is a windsock a the top of the hill above the south east corner of the LZ.</p>

<div class="">
  Landing Approaches
</div>

<div class=""><!-- TODO: rewrite this -->
  <p>  A figure 8 approach is the most commonly used approach for paragliders.  Pilots typically approach from the west and land to the ESE, regardless of wind direction.  Overshooting your landing could put you in a tree or on the highway.  As with any restricted landing field approach stay in your figure 8 pattern if you encounter lift.  Wide north to south S turns will enable a gentle approach and avoid the need to make sharp turns close to the ground.
</p>

  <p>It is often S/SE in the LZ and with the topography and tress to the south
this can create a wind shadow, be prepared to land short on final, if it
looks like you might land in or near the ditch it is better to turn back and
land west of the ditch. </p>

<p>Clear the LZ after landing.</p>


</div>
<div class="">
  <p></p>
</div>

<div class="">
  Downwind Base and Final
</div>

<p>Used mostly by hang gliders the Downwind Base and Final (Aircraft) approach works too.  Pilots typically begin by losing altitude over the hill to the SE of the LZ.  Approximately 400 feet above the LZ, turn & fly over Hwy 93 to the NW.  Extend or shorten your downwind leg as needed.  The base leg is usually rather short, almost a 180 degree turn back into the
LZ. If you are too high, simply turn parallel to the hillside and finish the
approach using the Figure 8 method. </p>

<p>This method can be used to extend the airspace if several pilots are landing at the same time.</p>

<p>Clear the LZ after landing.</p>

  <div class="panel-heading">Miner's Field Landing Zone</div>
  <div class="panel-body">

<p>The Miner's field LZ is a good alternative to the primary LZ.  Using the Miner's field in a south wind is a safer option as there is no mechanical turbulance found in the primary LZ under those conditions.  The field slopes slightly downhill.  Newer pilots should set up their approach at the base of the hill over the water tanks.</p>

<p>There is a thin flag at the bottom of the hill to indicate wind direction.</p>
