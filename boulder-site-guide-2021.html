  <div class="card-body">

    <p>Boulder is the most popular site on the front range.   Boluder is the primary learning site on the Front Range. Advanced XC pilots use Boulder as starting point for journeys north or south. Newer and mid-level pilots can get a good workout hiking while making multiple flights per day. On flyable days students often start flying early. Mid day conditions can be strong.</p>

  <p>Boulder is best flown when the wind is coming from the East. South can work too. North days can be dangerous as rotor turbulence can shut down the site.</p>

  <p>The upper launch is about 600 feet vertical.</p>

  <p>Recomended wind strength goes here</p>

  <p> RMHPA will continue to work with the City of Boulder Open Space and Mountain Parks on future recreational-management plans concerning hang gliding and paragliding activities. These guidelines are subject to revision if any new issues arise.</p>
  <h4>City of Boulder Open Space and Mountain Parks General Site Guidelines</h4>


  <p>4. All pilots are advised that City Regulations prohibit litter, such as flagging, as well as the removal of rocks or plants from their place on OSMP land. Any flagging used must be removed at the end of each flying day.</p>
  <p>Pilots are strongly encouraged to consider their small incremental impact on the erosion of the land. The following <strong>OSMP Site Use Requirements</strong> will help to minimize erosion. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Do not use the sites at all when the ground is very wet or muddy</li>
    <li>Use only designated trails to get to/from launch and landing areas, stay on the trail</li>
    <li>Diversify your exit from landing areas to the nearest designated trail</li>
    <li>Do not create a social trails by repeatedly using the same unofficial path to a launch area</li>
    <li>When possible, launch from, or close to, a designated trail</li>
    <li>Avoid travelling in or through the gullies except on existing designated trails</li>
    <li>Shake out your gear in the LZ before going back up to launch to minimize unwanted weeds, like cheat and jointed goat grass, that hitchhike.</li>
    <li>If a set-up or launch area is looking worn, diversify your activity to allow the area time to recover.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>City of Boulder Open Space and Mountain Parks Specific Site Guidelines</h3>
  <h4>Guidelines for Wonderland Lakes Area</h4>
  <p>Parking in the Locust Avenue area is generally not a problem for small numbers of pilots. However, large groups are encouraged to carpool in from the Foothills Nature Center Trailhead at 4201 North Broadway, Boulder.</p>
  <p>The Wonderland Lake upper, three-quarter and half-way, or bench, launches are H2/P2 or Supervised H1/P1.</p>
  <p>Follow the OSMP site use requirements listed above.</p>
  <p>NOTE: Scott Westfall's property is considered Private. Please do not Trespass. Launching from there is by invitation only.</p>




  <h4>Guidelines for the South Wonderland Lake Launch</h4>
  <p><strong>This is a drop-off-only launch area.</strong>  <strong>Do</strong><strong> not  park on Pine Needle Road.  &nbsp;</strong>Pilots accessing the launch from the west side of the ridge  are <strong>required to be</strong> <strong>dropped off </strong>with their gear<strong> at the pull-out/turnaround area</strong> of  Pine Needle Road (see map), <strong>while the  driver returns to the Foothills Nature Center or Locust Avenue parking areas.</strong>  Illegal parking on Pine Needle Road is enforced by the  Boulder County Sheriff and Open Space and Mountain Parks Rangers.  <strong></strong></p>
  <p>
    Please review the <a href="/images/northboulder_pineneedle.pdf"> Pine Needle Road Access guidelines</a>
  </p>
  Please  respect the privacy of property owners. Do not drive beyond the pull-out area,  as there are no other places to turn around. Do not turn around in private  driveways.
  <p>This launch area is H2/P2 or Supervised H1/P1.</p>
  <p>Follow the OSMP site use requirements listed above.</p>
