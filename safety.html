	<p>Most of the time thermals are the primary source of lift at RMHPA sites.  A typical good day looks like:</p>

	<dl class="row">
		<dt class="col-sm-3">Early Morning</dt>
		<dd class="col-sm-9">Light thermals winds often in the 3-10 mph range.  A good time to fly a new site.  Low airtime pilots can gain experience.</dd>
	</dl>
	<dl class="row">
		<dt class="col-sm-3">Morning Cook</dt>
		<dd class="col-sm-9">Soarable conditions as thermals get stronger.</dd>
	</dl>
	<dl class="row">
		<dt class="col-sm-3">Transition</dt>
		<dd class="col-sm-9">Thermal activity shuts off as mid day conditions build.</dd>
	</dl>
	<dl class="row">
		<dt class="col-sm-3">Mid Day Conditions</dt>
		<dd class="col-sm-9">Strong thermal activity with winds ranging from 0-25 mph. Advanced pilots only.  Strong thermal cycles exceed everyone's opperating limitations. Good judgement and experience are required to fly safely in mid day conditions.</dd>

	<dl class="row">
		<dt class="col-sm-3">Evening</dt>
