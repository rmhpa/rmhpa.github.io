		<p><strong><img src="/images/mgaggle.jpg" alt="Mt. Zion" width="200" height="150" style="float:left;padding:4px;" />Mt. Zion (Lookout Mtn):</strong> The Lookout flying site, located on Mt. Zion in Golden, has restricted landing fields, is in the public eye, and is one of very few sites along the Front Range. Lookout Launch is located on Jefferson County Open Space land. Lookout LZ is owned by the Colorado School of Mines and by the City of Golden. We fly with permission of these organizations and are required to restrict flying at Lookout to qualified pilots. With that said, we&rsquo;ll do everything we can to help qualified pilots enjoy this great flying site as much as we do!</p>
	  <p> Th site is at approximately 6500ft MSL, 900ft above the primary LZ. Launches include possible NE, E, and SE. It's primarily a thermal site with little ridge soaring opportunity. Flying is possible year round. It has good XC potential; the Colorado state hang gliding record was set here - 187 miles by Brad Koji, and paragliding record of 102 miles by Jan Voegeli.</p>
		<ul>
		  <li>Primary LZ is at the base of the  mountain, about 400 yds by 200 yds on Colorado School of Mines property. </li>
	      <li>Minimum Pilot Rating for visiting pilots - Hang 3 for Hanglider and P3 for Paraglider pilots<br />
            </li>
	      <li>Times  to Fly - Mornings are mostly calm, suitable for sponsoring new pilots. Midday finds strong thermal activity with frequent thunderstorms from May-August. Evenings occasionally glass off. </li>
	  </ul>
		<p> You must be a member of the USHPA and the RMHPA to fly this site due to landowner liability issues and you must meet RMHPA requirements for flying this site. </p>
