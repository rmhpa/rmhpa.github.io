      Primarilly a morning site, Bellyache Ridge is the most consistent of the Vail sites. It is a morning site that faces northeast to southeast and is usually flyable from 7:00 am to noon. Bellyache is an east facing site and is flying capable most mornings. Prevailing wind is from the southwest to northwest. The morning katabatic flow from the Rocky Mountain Divide facilitates an easterly wind flow in the morning. Sun and light thermals also enhance this dynamic, and usually we have a 4 to 6 hour morning window to fly.

  <div class="panel-heading">Launch</div>
  <div class="panel-body">

    <p>Launch is a dirt and grass open area where three gliders can be laid out span wise and two deep.
    Launch does drop off quickly with the left side more appropriate for solo new pilots. The left side is more convex and there is a gradual steeping of the launch run without a large drop off. The right side is more gradual with an abrupt drop off and is only used by more experienced pilots.</p>

    <p>There is a path that leads to the launch area with designated signs indicating the pilotâ€™s only area. There is a spectator area that is off to the side with a sign and path showing the access. There is a wooden bench where spectators can watch from behind launch.

    Individual pilots should respect the dedicated Tandem launch area.

Winds average 8 to 12 mph early with lighter conditions mid-morning. Late morning before the wind switch moderate thermals can develop with winds increasing from 5 to 15 mph in the stronger cycles. This usually happens late morning. By 12 noon the prevailing mixes down and flying is done for the day. This site lends itself to very consistent conditions and you can almost set you watch daily to the weather dynamics.

The wind direction can be from the southeast to north to fly this site. There is a wind open window as launch is completely clear to the airflow. All other directions are not favorable.
