<p>
  Bellyache Ridge is the most consistent of the Vail sites. It is a morning site that faces northeast to southeast and is usually flyable from 7:00 am to noon. This site offers perfect conditions for the beginner to advanced pilot. Early morning offers calm, smooth conditions for pilots just getting started to mid-day conditions and high altitude gains of 1,000 to 4,000 feet. This site is located 20 minutes west of Vail, and provides easy access with a paved road.

  Primarily flown in the mornings before the winds shift and come 'over the back'. Watch out for the wind shift.
