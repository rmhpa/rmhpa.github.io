<p>
  The Vail Valley's mid-day to evening flying site. It faces west and is generally flyable from noon to sunset. We find the evening is the best time to fly this site as conditions become perfect for hours of soaring and high altitude gains of 1,000 to 8,000 feet above launch level. The road to launch is a rough 4-wheel drive road, and you must access this site with a local pilot. The landing is on private property, permissible through an agreement between the Vail Soaring Club and the property
  owners. This site offers the best situation for cross-country flights, and there have been numerous cross-country flights from 5 to 50 miles. It is located 30 minutes from Vail.
