<p>Copper is an advanced site (P4/H4 only) requires a ski pass and requires close cordination with the Ski Patrol.  Summit County offers several other sites that are much less restrictive, and more accessable.  </p>

<p>Advanced Pilots please review this Document:

  <h5 class="card-header">Site Considerations</h5>

  <div class="card-body">

    <ul class="list-group">
      <li class="list-group-item">Pilots need to be very conserative with winds 6 to 10 mph for launching. </li>
      <li class="list-group-item">In summer, the valley heats quickly and thermals form in less than 30 minutes making midday dangerous for paragliding.</li>
      <li class="list-group-item">In winter, storm fronts include high wind and gusting.
	Pilots should not fly in these conditions due to high risk and liability.</li>

  <tr><td>HG 3 - 12 mph</td><td>12 mph</td></tr>
  <tr><td>PG 3 - 10 mph</td><td>10 mph</td></tr>

  <p>Each pilot needs to individually determine his/her ideal flying conditions.</p>


<li class="list-group-item">Summer drive up access is available for three approved/registered/insured vehicles and licensed drivers.</li>

    </ul>



<h6 class="card-header">Winter Flying</h6>
<li class="list-group-item">Ski patrol determines when to open and close launch. Flying is generally permitted when Storm King lift &amp; Upper Enchancted Forest is open.</li>
<li class="list-group-item">Site director must check-in with ski patrol on the day of flying. Pilots access the mountain as a regular skier or snowboarder.</li>
<li class="list-group-item">Lift ticket or season pass to access the mountain is required. Pilots must ski/ride down the mountain on proper equipment when conditions do not permit flying.</li>
<li class="list-group-item">Storm King lift closes at 3pm. Pilots must exit the launch area at this time and prior to Ski Patrol clearing run (no exceptions).</li>

<h6 class="card-header">Summer Flying</h6>
<li class="list-group-item">Copper Resort Mountain Operations determines when to open road access, which is generally at the start of summer season (2nd weekend in June).</li>
<li class="list-group-item">Summer road access continues until mid-October unless snow covers the road and/or Mountain Operations shuts down access.
	Early morning flights are consistent in the summer.</li>
<li class="list-group-item">H4/P4 pilot need to make good choices since conditions can change within 15 minutes as thermals build quickly.</li>
<li class="list-group-item">Given no over development, evening flights can be obtained with proper conditions.</li>
