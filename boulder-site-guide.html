<p>
  The North Boulder site is located at the west end of Locust St. in the Northern end of Boulder, west of Broadway St.
</p>

<h4>Background</h4>

<p>
  The Boulder site is used by pilots of all levels.  Boluder is the primary learning site on the Front Range.  Advanced XC pilots use Boulder as starting point for journeys north or south.  Newer and mid-level pilots can get a good workout hiking while making multiple flights per day.  On flyable days students often start flying early.  Mid morning is a good time to fly for experienced pilots.  Mid day conditions can be strong.
</p>

<p>Boulder is best flown when the wind is coming from the East.  South can work too.  North days can be dangerous as rotor turbulence can shut down the site.</p>

<p>The upper launch is about 600 feet vertical.</p>

<h4>Soaring</h4>
<p>  Generally there is one chance to catch a thermal and climb.  If you do catch a thermal, you can fly to the saddle right of launch and ridge soar.  If you get about 2000 feet over launch you can try to fly to Lyons which is about 10 miles to the North.</p>

<h4>Radio Frequency</h4>

<p>The RMHPA supports hang gliding and paragliding activities within the City of Boulder Open Space and Mountain Parks. All pilots <strong>must</strong> abide by the requirements and follow all of the strong encouragements as well as the City Regulations mentioned below to stay within the spirit of these guidelines and ensure our continued access to OSMP lands. Contact any of the officers of the RMHPA if you wish to record a significant deviation from these guidelines. This will help in the effort to monitor the Boulder Open Space and Mountain Parks flying sites. Contact OSMP at 303-441-3440 if you wish to report an illegal activity or call 9-1-1 for an emergency. RMHPA will continue to work with the City of Boulder Open Space and Mountain Parks on future recreational-management plans concerning hang gliding and paragliding activities. These guidelines are subject to revision if any new issues arise.</p>
<h4>City of Boulder Open Space and Mountain Parks General Site Guidelines</h4>
<p>1. USHPAâ€™s site insurance policy requires all pilots, including first-day students and visiting pilots, be USHPA members at the time of their use of OSMP sites. This provides uniform third-party liability insurance for all pilots. You may call USHPA at 800-616-6888 or visit them on-line at <a href="http://www.ushpa.org/">www.ushpa.org</a>. All students are encouraged to hire only USHPA-rated paragliding or hang gliding instructors. All students can and should report any safety-related complaints to USHPA. Local schools can be found in the yellow pages or on the RMHPA's website at <a href="http://www.rmhpa.org/">www.rmhpa.org</a>. Schools are strongly encouraged to distribute a copy of these guidelines to each student before they receive instruction at any Boulder OSMP site. Copies are distributed free upon request from the RMHPA or can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.rmhpa.org/">www.rmhpa.org</a>.</p>
<p>2. RMHPA requires all pilots to join the club before flying at OSMP sites. This is necessary for two reasons. First, OSMP requires RMHPA to insure the sites on their property. This insurance provides different coverage than your USHPA membership insurance. Your membership supports this expense. Second, USHPA site insurance requirements specify that all pilots that fly an insured site be members of the organization insuring the site. In addition, your membership is a way for you to ensure you are informed of current site issues, concerns, and events. Membership information can be found at <a href="http://www.rmhpa.org/">www.rmhpa.org</a> under &quot;<a href="http://www.rmhpa.org/join">Join the RMHPA</a>.&quot;</p>
<p>3. All pilots are strongly encouraged to wear a suitable helmet while ground handling and required to wear one when flying a USHPA insured site. All pilots are strongly encouraged to wear a parachute except where explicitly supervised by a USHPA-rated Instructor. Pilots are strongly encouraged to have ratings equal to or greater than those shown for the sites in these guidelines.</p>
<p>4. All pilots are advised that City Regulations prohibit litter, such as flagging, as well as the removal of rocks or plants from their place on OSMP land. Any flagging used must be removed at the end of each flying day.</p>
<p>Pilots are strongly encouraged to consider their small incremental impact on the erosion of the land. The following <strong>OSMP Site Use Requirements</strong> will help to minimize erosion. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Do not use the sites at all when the ground is very wet or muddy</li>
  <li>Use only designated trails to get to/from launch and landing areas, stay on the trail</li>
  <li>Diversify your exit from landing areas to the nearest designated trail</li>
  <li>Do not create a social trails by repeatedly using the same unofficial path to a launch area</li>
  <li>When possible, launch from, or close to, a designated trail</li>
  <li>Avoid travelling in or through the gullies except on existing designated trails</li>
  <li>Shake out your gear in the LZ before going back up to launch to minimize unwanted weeds, like cheat and jointed goat grass, that hitchhike.</li>
  <li>If a set-up or launch area is looking worn, diversify your activity to allow the area time to recover.</li>
</ul>
<h3>City of Boulder Open Space and Mountain Parks Specific Site Guidelines</h3>
<h4>Guidelines for Wonderland Lakes Area</h4>
<p>Parking in the Locust Avenue area is generally not a problem for small numbers of pilots. However, large groups are encouraged to carpool in from the Foothills Nature Center Trailhead at 4201 North Broadway, Boulder.</p>
<p>The Wonderland Lake upper, three-quarter and half-way, or bench, launches are H2/P2 or Supervised H1/P1.</p>
<p>Follow the OSMP site use requirements listed above.</p>
<p>NOTE: Scott Westfall's property is considered Private. Please do not Trespass. Launching from there is by invitation only.</p>
<h4>Guidelines for the South Wonderland Lake Launch</h4>
<p><strong>This is a drop-off-only launch area.</strong>  <strong>Do</strong><strong> not  park on Pine Needle Road.  &nbsp;</strong>Pilots accessing the launch from the west side of the ridge  are <strong>required to be</strong> <strong>dropped off </strong>with their gear<strong> at the pull-out/turnaround area</strong> of  Pine Needle Road (see map), <strong>while the  driver returns to the Foothills Nature Center or Locust Avenue parking areas.</strong>  Illegal parking on Pine Needle Road is enforced by the  Boulder County Sheriff and Open Space and Mountain Parks Rangers.  <strong></strong></p>
<p>
  Please review the <a href="/images/northboulder_pineneedle.pdf"> Pine Needle Road Access guidelines</a>
</p>
Please  respect the privacy of property owners. Do not drive beyond the pull-out area,  as there are no other places to turn around. Do not turn around in private  driveways.
<p>This launch area is H2/P2 or Supervised H1/P1.</p>
<p>Follow the OSMP site use requirements listed above.</p>

<p><strong>Miniwings</strong></p>

<p>Excellent training area, reliable sledders, also possible to soar these sites, allow adequate separation from terrain, smallest recommended wing to make LZ: 12m.</p>
