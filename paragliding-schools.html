<p>Hang Gliding and Paragliding are governed by the United States Hanggliding and Paragliding Association (USHPA) under an exemption granted by the FAA.  Newcommers to the sport need instruction, and a rating granted by USHPA. </p>

<p>The Rmhpa community stronly recomends starting your flying career with a local instructor.  Using a local instructor gives you the opportunity to develop a mentor to guide you long after your formal training ends.</p>
