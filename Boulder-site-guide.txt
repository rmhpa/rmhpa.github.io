Boulder Site Description


The Boulder flying site is located in North Boulder.

There are 3 launches.  The large landing zone makes North Boulder the best site on the Front Range for learning to fly.

Students progress through the Lower and 3/4 launches before flying the upper launch.  Experienced P2 pilots can fly the upper launch.

Boulder is best flown when the wind is coming from the East.  South can work too.  North days can be dangerous as rotor turbulence can shut down the site.

The upper launch is about 600 feet vertical.  Generally there is one chance to catch a thermal and climb.  If you do catch a thermal, you can fly to the saddle right of launch and ridge soar.  If you get about 2000 feet over launch you can try to fly to Lyons which is about 10 miles to the North.
