<p>
  Located near Villa Grove, CO in the San Luis Valley. Site
    faces SW, launch at approximately 9,300 ft MSL, The primary LZ is at 7500 ft MSL
    and is miles and miles of grass and short sage fields starting at the base of
    the Sangre De Cristo range. The Sangre De Cristos range from 12,000ft MSL to
    over 14,000ft MSL and run unbroken for over 60 miles to the south of launch,
    then a 15 mile gap and continuing into New Mexico. Both ridge soaring and thermal
    opportunities. Flying often possible year round. Great XC potential. Often called
    the little Owens Valley.
</p>

<p>  Mornings are usually light winded, suitable for Hang 2 and P2's.
  Midday can have strong thermal activity with sudden changes in wind velocity
  due to thunderstorms from May-August. Beware of storms and sudden gust fronts.
  It is common for the San Luis valley to have a visible inversion at about 2,000ft
  AGL. Pilots excercising patience and hanging onto a good thermal can break through
  the inversion and soar the stronger ridge and thermal lift above the inversion
  on the San Luis Mtns. Not commonly flown by paragliders during midday due to
  the stronger winds above the inversion and turbulent thermals. Evenings often
  offer a spectacular glass off. Local HG pilot Larry Smith lives just south of
  the LZ.</p>

    <p>Contacting a local pilot highly advised prior to first flights at Villa.  Cell coverage is weak and local weather conditions can be very different than forecasts.  Be careful of strong upper winds and a strong venturi at Hayden pass.</p>

<p>Launch faces southwest, altitude is 9,300 feet.  This is a high altitude launch site.  Strong kiting skills and good launch technique are required.  Pilots must be prepared to manage strong thermic launch conditions.  Pilots with weaker kiting skills may be dragged.  </p>

<p>
    While Villa Grove is technically a H2/P2/M2 site w/ High Altitude and Turbulence endorsements. Hang 3 other times. Winds can increase suddenly, making it dangerous for paragliding midday.
    Best conditions: 5-10 mph for PG; 10-15 for HG SW-W-NW; Upper level winds must be checked and respected—talk with locals. Winds on launch may seem acceptable but strong winds may develop suddenly especially in the valley and in passes making conditions very dangerous. Overdevelopment with thunderstorms and associated hazards can also develop very quickly.

    Always fly within the USHPA recommended operating limitations for your rating as specified in the USHPA Pilot Proficiency System. 

    Best time(s) of day to fly: Mornings are usually light winded, suitable for Hang 2 and P2's. Midday can be active with strong thermal activity with sudden changes in wind velocity due to thunderstorms from May-August. Beware of storms and sudden gust fronts. It is common for the San Juan valley to have a visible inversion at about 2,000ft AGL. Pilots excercising patience and hanging onto a good thermal can break through the inversion and soar the stronger ridge and thermal lift above the inversion on the San Juan Mtns. Not commonly flown by paragliders during midday due to the stronger winds above the inversion and turbulent thermals. Evenings often offer a spectacular glass off. Early afternoon during winter / morning or evening glass off during summer. Mid-day flying on strong thermal/active days can be very rowdy and potentially dangerous.
    Most flyable season(s):  April through October, Occasional days in winter if snow pack allows access to launch. Paragliding not recommended mid-day in warmer months. For mid-day conditions, H3/P3/M3 or higher, is recommended.
</p>

<p>Hang gliders use an earthen launch ramp located to the North of launch.  There are 2 dedicated Paraglider launch areas are located just to the south of the hang glider ramp. There are several flags below launch that indicate wind direction and thermals.  The launch is on US Forest Service land and minimally improved.</p>

<!-- TODO: picture of launch -->

<!-- TODO: hook in picture -->


<p>To access launch pilots typically drive the 4WD road.   Launch parking is limited. Make sure you are parked completely clear of the road at launch. </p>

<!-- TODO: get photos from google earth -->

On Launch, hang gliders typically set up slightly lower to the north and paragliders to the south. Pilots must ensure they have good launch techniques and paraglider pilots need to be aware of the danger of being drug into hang gliders setup behind their launch location.

    <p>Primary LZ is next to the road to launch, about 1 mile from launch at 7500ft
    below launch. Almost the whole San Luis valley is landable, making outlandings
    easy.</p>

    <p>The San Luis valley is known for strong thermals and gust fronts.  Mid-day landings can be tricky.</p>

    <p>RMHPA insurrs the private property to the SW of the primary landing zone.  If you land at this residence you need to be a member of RMHPA.</p>

  <li class="list-group-item">If you climb to the ridge above launch be aware of the potential for compression.  Winds near the ridge may be substantially stronger at ridge line.  For paragliders a 15 MPH in the valley compress along the ridgeline to the point where you may get blown over the back.</li>

  <li class="list-group-item">Beware of the strong venturi in Hayden Pass.</li>

  <li class="list-group-item">All pilots desiring to fly Villa Grove should talk with pilots that have flown Villa Grove and be thoroughly briefed on its hazards.</li>

  <li class="list-group-item">Launch is owned by the US Forest Service.  The Sangre De Cristo Wilderness boundry begins just above launch.</li>

  <li class="list-group-item">Almost all of the San Luis Valley has open areas to land but do not land in the Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve. Check with local pilots for other restricted landing areas.</li>

  <li class="list-group-item">Air Space: Villa Grove is in class G airspace up to 1200’ above the surface, above 1200’ it is Class E airspace.  There are scattered small air fields and some victor airways around the Valley.  Strongly consider portable Oxygen, and stay under 18,000 MSL.</li>
