  <p>Hang Gliding and Paragliding ratings and instructional standards are set by the United States Hang Gliding and Paragliding Association (USHPA).  USHPA has been granted an exemption by the FAA to permit tandem instruction, and also provides insurance to accredited instructors and schools.  USHPA also provides insurance for many flying sites, and works to obtain access for new flying sites.
