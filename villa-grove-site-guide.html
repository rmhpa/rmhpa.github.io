    <strong>Villa Grove:</strong> Located near Villa Grove, CO in the San Luis Valley. Site
      faces SW, launch at approximately 9,300ft MSL, The primary LZ is at 7500ft MSL
      and is miles and miles of grass and short sage fields starting at the base of
      the Sangre De Cristo range. The Sangre De Cristos range from 12,000ft MSL to
      over 14,000ft MSL and run unbroken for over 60 miles to the south of launch,
      then a 15 mile gap and continuing into New Mexico. Both ridge soaring and thermal
      opportunities. Flying often possible year round. Great XC potential. Often called
      the little Owens Valley.
  </p>
  <p>
    Primary LZ is next to the road to launch, about 1 mile from launch at 7500ft
    below launch. Almost the whole San Luis valley is landable, making outlandings
    easy.

    Recommended Pilot Rating - Hang 2 for hanglider pilots and P2 for paraglider
    pilots during morning and late evening. Hang 3 other times. Winds can increase
    suddenly, making it dangerous for paragliding midday.
  </p>

  <p>
    Times to Fly - Mornings are usually light winded, suitable for Hang 2 and P2's.
    Midday can ahve strong thermal activity with sudden changes in wind velocity
    due to thunderstorms from May-August. Beware of storms and sudden gust fronts.
    It is common for the San Juan valley to have a visible inversion at about 2,000ft
    AGL. Pilots excercising patience and hanging onto a good thermal can break through
    the inversion and soar the stronger ridge and thermal lift above the inversion
    on the San Juan Mtns. Not commonly flown by paragliders during midday due to
    the stronger winds above the inversion and turbulent thermals. Evenings often
    offer a spectacular glass off. Local HG pilot Larry Smith lives just south of
    the LZ.

  There are several other sites to fly in the area,
  including Whale, which faces SE. It is most often flown in the summertime before
  about 11am. Later in the day the wind often comes over the back, but this site
  is very relable in the morning. Launch is about 10 miles NW of the Villa Grove
  launch. Probably the nicest launch above 12,000ft MSL you will ever see!
